      <h2>LETS(Learn Exploratory Testing System)</h2><br>
      <p>
        Often times during the software development process, requirements or specifications aren't always present. There are also cases where the complexity of
        an application doesn't allow scripted/automated testing to cover different state transitions of the software. Exploratory testing is used in these cases
        where the tester uses black-box techniques to manually test the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        LETS was created to teach exploratory testing in a controlled environment. This application gives testers a starting point to go through the testing
        process.
