easter eggs

1. "sing in" instead of "sign in"

2. when user is signed in, they can still register by changing url
   (to fix: don't let authenticated users access register.)

   2.1 Same thing with /user/game/new and /user/game/view



3. Return winner is not the currect winner. It only returns the first username in the list.
   Hint: A function to calculate winner is already present in the javascript(get_winner()). 


4. Extra character in real name in the profile page.

5. Exra html code in the home page and the profile page.
